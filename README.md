# MC-Server-Script
This script allows for clean starts, restarts, and maint. shutdowns of both standard and modified Minecraft servers.

Requires Java and screen to function properly. Usage details can be found by running the script sans arguments.

Please note that the 'version' argument only works on Bukkit servers and their derivatives.

Script is based on one written by various memebers of the Escapecraft community, primarily wokka and Tulonsae. This version was updated to support a modded server run by Spyboticsguy - myself - for the Escapecraft team, and is a 'generic' form of the script that should be deployable in multiple environments.
